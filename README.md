🩺 Smart Glove for Remote Patient Monitoring

This project is a prototype of a wearable healthcare monitoring system designed to continuously measure and transmit a patient’s vital signs in real-time. The glove integrates sensors to monitor:

🌡️ Temperature (DHT22)

💧 Humidity (DHT22)

❤️ Heart Rate (MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter)

🫁 SpO₂ (Blood Oxygen Level) (MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter)

The collected data is sent to the Blynk IoT platform, allowing remote monitoring of patients via a mobile application. This makes it useful for applications in telemedicine, elderly care, and continuous health tracking.

🔧 Tech Stack

Hardware: ESP32, DHT22, MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter

Software: Arduino IDE, Blynk IoT

Languages: C/C++

🚨 Features

Real-time monitoring of vital parameters

Alerts for abnormal values (high temperature, low SpO₂, irregular heart rate)

Remote visualization via the Blynk mobile app

Cost-effective and portable prototype for smart healthcare
